Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.

The management has observed that they lack sufficient insights to make quick and informed data-driven decisions. 

To address this, they plan to expand their data analytics team by hiring several junior data analysts.

The data analytics director has decided to conduct a SQL challenge to evaluate the candidates' skills.

As a data analyst, I am dedicated to providing the crucial insights necessary for quick and informed decision-making. 

By leveraging my expertise, I strive to deliver the detailed and actionable data analysis that management needs to drive smart, data-informed strategies.
